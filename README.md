# GS.Asteroids
### Asteroids clone for the Apple IIgs computer

Download available in the [Downloads Section](https://github.com/peterhirschberg/GS.Asteroids/releases)

Special thanks to Jeremy Rand for his invaluable help and advice, his [build pipeline](https://github.com/jeremysrand/Apple2BuildPipeline), and his inspiring Centipede clone "[BuGS](https://github.com/jeremysrand/BuGS)".

## Hardware requirements

This game currently requires a machine running at at least 8mhz, so unfortunately an accelerator card is required. It will throttle itself above 8mhz so if you are running it in an emulator, just set it for "Unlimited".
